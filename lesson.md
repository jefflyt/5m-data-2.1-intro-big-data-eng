# Lesson

## Brief

### Preparation

Install conda environments required for the rest of module. Go to the `environments` folder and create the conda environments based on the `environment.yml` file. Each `yml` file is prefixed with the environment name. 

For example, to create the `bde` environment:

`conda env create --file bde-environment.yml`

To replace an existing environment:

`conda env update --file bde-environment.yml --prune`

### For Windows WSL Users

If you get an error message when creating the `bde` environment, e.g.
> ERROR: Could not build wheels for thriftpy2, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects.

Run the following CLI command from your terminal:

`sudo apt install build-essential`
